# VR-Norms

A necessary rule when working with the VR headsets is to not disturb the person with the VR headset on, or else it might frighten them and cause a scene in the classroom. This could lead to accidentally tripping, or unintended harm to others as well.

Keep the VR Headset projected so that we can examine features such as unique game UIs together, and this way it is impossible for people to mess around with the headset.

Vr headsets must stay in a specific area of the room, to avoid people tripping on objects

Follow a turn order list up on the board that ensures everyone gets an equal chance if they want to use the headsets.

Have a waiting line for people who want to test the games/play in vr, so that there isn’t any hustle or competition for who gets to use the headsets. First come first serve basis maybe?
There needs to be a system where everyone can have an equal amount of time on the VR. This could potentially be a system where you select 2 people from the top of the attendance chart, you give them all of that period to use the VR, then for the next day select the 2 below in the chart to use it. This would happen every weekday apart from Wednesday because there is less time.

 Last to use the vr has to clean it up and make sure to charge it

One group or max 3 people at a time.

Make sure the area is free from obstacles. Use the Guardian system, set up before each use.
Always be aware of your surroundings, and make sure to create a boundary of some sort to avoid bumping into certain things.

People with motion sickness should not use headsets. Have someone else as a test player.

Do not get too close to someone wearing a headset. Don't touch them.

Equipment must be respected and handled with care when using. VR should be a privilege, so if you break the rules you will not be allowed access to it.

We should have a paper where you can “rent out” the headsets, with the person that took it out, date and time you took it out and put the headset back.
Those who don't want to use the headsets do not have to.
 

Be gentle with the headsets as they are really expensive. 
Clear out space that’s only reserved for playing with the headsets so that there’s space to move around without getting hurt.
Students of Vr must be in clear standing with the class. Students with missing work should prioritize working on outstanding work first -- Baez
