A necessary rule when working with the VR headsets is to not disturb the person with 
the VR headset on, or else it might frighten them and cause a scene in the classroom. 
This could lead to accidentally tripping, or unintended harm to others as well.

Keep the VR Headset projected so that we can examine features such as unique game UIs t
ogether, and this way it is impossible for people to mess around with the headset.

Vr headsets must stay in a specific area of the room, to avoid people tripping on objects

Follow a turn order list up on the board that ensures everyone gets an equal chance
if they want to use the headsets.

Have a waiting line for people who want to test the games/play in vr, so that there
isn’t any hustle or competition for who gets to use the headsets. First come first
serve basis maybe? There needs to be a system where everyone can have an equal amount
of time on the VR. This could potentially be a system where you select 2 people from
the top of the attendance chart, you give them all of that period to use the VR,
then for the next day select the 2 below in the chart to use it. This would happen
every weekday apart from Wednesday because there is less time.

Last to use the vr has to clean it up and make sure to charge it

One group or max 3 people at a time.

Make sure the area is free from obstacles. Use the Guardian system, set up before
each use. Always be aware of your surroundings, and make sure to create a boundary
of some sort to avoid bumping into certain things.

People with motion sickness should not use headsets. Have someone else as a test
player.

Do not get too close to someone wearing a headset. Don't touch them.

Equipment must be respected and handled with care when using. VR should be a
privilege, so if you break the rules you will not be allowed access to it.

We should have a paper where you can “rent out” the headsets, with the person
that took it out, date and time you took it out and put the headset back. Those
who don't want to use the headsets do not have to.

Be gentle with the headsets as they are really expensive. Clear out space
that’s only reserved for playing with the headsets so that there’s space
to move around without getting hurt. Students of Vr must be in clear standing
with the class. Students with missing work should prioritize working on outstanding
work first

I agree to the norms listed on Schoology.
